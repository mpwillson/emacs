MULTIPLE PROCESS SUPPORT
===========================================================================
To run multiple Clojure processes, you start the first up
with \\[inf-clojure].  It will be in a buffer named `*inf-clojure*'.
Rename this buffer with \\[rename-buffer].  You may now start up a new
process with another \\[inf-clojure].  It will be in a new buffer,
named `*inf-clojure*'.  You can switch between the different process
buffers with \\[switch-to-buffer].

Commands that send text from source buffers to Clojure processes --
like `clojure-eval-defun' or `clojure-show-arglist' -- have to choose a process
to send to, when you have more than one Clojure process around.  This
is determined by the global variable `inf-clojure-buffer'.  Suppose you
have three inferior Clojures running:
    Buffer              Process
    foo                 inf-clojure
    bar                 inf-clojure<2>
    *inf-clojure*     inf-clojure<3>
If you do a \\[clojure-eval-defun] command on some Clojure source code,
what process do you send it to?

- If you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *inf-clojure*),
  you send it to that process.
- If you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you
  send it to the process attached to buffer `inf-clojure-buffer'.
This process selection is performed by function `inf-clojure-proc'.

Whenever \\[inf-clojure] fires up a new process, it resets
`inf-clojure-buffer' to be the new process's buffer.  If you only run
one process, this does the right thing.  If you run multiple
processes, you might need to change `inf-clojure-buffer' to
whichever process buffer you want to use.")

(defvar inf-clojure-mode-hook '()
  "Hook for customizing Inferior Clojure mode.")

(put 'inf-clojure-mode 'mode-class 'special)

(define-derived-mode inf-clojure-mode comint-mode "Inferior Clojure"
  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior Clojure process.
Runs a Clojure interpreter as a subprocess of Emacs, with Clojure I/O through an
Emacs buffer.  Variable `inf-clojure-program' controls which Clojure interpreter
is run.  Variables `inf-clojure-prompt', `inf-clojure-filter-regexp' and
`inf-clojure-load-command' can customize this mode for different Clojure
interpreters.

For information on running multiple processes in multiple buffers, see
documentation for variable `inf-clojure-buffer'.

\\{inf-clojure-mode-map}

Customization: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`inf-clojure-mode-hook' (in that order).

You can send text to the inferior Clojure process from other buffers containing
Clojure source.
    `switch-to-clojure' switches the current buffer to the Clojure process buffer.
    `clojure-eval-defun' sends the current defun to the Clojure process.
    `clojure-eval-region' sends the current region to the Clojure process.

    Prefixing the clojure-eval/defun/region commands with
    a \\[universal-argument] causes a switch to the Clojure process buffer after sending
    the text.

Commands:\\<inf-clojure-mode-map>
\\[comint-send-input] after the end of the process' output sends the text from the
    end of process to point.
\\[comint-send-input] before the end of the process' output copies the sexp ending at point
    to the end of the process' output, and sends it.
\\[comint-copy-old-input] copies the sexp ending at point to the end of the process' output,
    allowing you to edit it before sending it.
If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is nil (the default), \\[comint-insert-input] on old input
   copies the entire old input to the end of the process' output, allowing
   you to edit it before sending it.  When not used on old input, or if
   `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is non-nil, \\[comint-insert-input] behaves according to
   its global binding.
\\[backward-delete-char-untabify] converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
\\[clojure-indent-line] indents for Clojure; with argument, shifts rest
    of expression rigidly with the current line.
\\[indent-sexp] does \\[clojure-indent-line] on each line starting within following expression.
Paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.  Semicolons start comments.
If you accidentally suspend your process, use \\[comint-continue-subjob]
to continue it."
